TODO
-Reduce power value of items by factor 10 [DONE]
-Adjust/Exclude certain items as seatreader feces [DONE]

-Add power consumption for planters
	->special cases for certain indoor fruit types with multiple yields [DONE]
    ->reduce power consumption of planters proportional to depth and light [DONE]
    ->implement seed to fruit and set all values properly [DONE]

-Add power consumption for containment [DONE]
    ->might need bigger power consumption because fishes breed fast [DONE]
    
-Add more power consumption and crafting duration to fabricator in Lifepod to encourage building a new one and making powercells of lifepod weaker [DONE]

Ideas:    
    -Maybe continous power drain instead of one time for planter [MAYBE]
    -Reduce lifepod energy
